BASIC RAY TRACER

Implemented the required methods.
To get the 3 different render types: signature/diffuse/phong, 2 flags were added to the original render methods.
Signature just shows the sum of the material's colors.
Diffuse omits the specular term.
Phong shows all terms.


WOODEN MONKEY

Implemented height-field water simulation in OpenGL 3.2
Resources used for example code and learning material:
	https://learnopengl.com/

A self-contained Windows compilation environment (Visual Studio 2015 solution) is in the folder 'woodenmonkey'
The final compiled .exe and dependencies are provided in 'woodenmonkey/x64/Debug'. 'woodenmonkey.exe' will run the program.
A video of the program in use is also in 'woodenmonkey'
The solution contains all external libraries, and it must be compiled for x64.

Controls:
	WASD to control the position of the magnet which pulls the fluid
	UpDownLeftRight to control the forward/backward speed and rotation of the turtle floating on the fluid
